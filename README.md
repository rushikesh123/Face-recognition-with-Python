# Face-recognition-with-Python
Face Recognition using python and OpenCv
Simple Face Recognition algorithm using Python and OpenCV

Requirement
Python 3.5
OpenCV 3.1.0
Numpy

Outline
This project consist of 3 parts, which are:

Creating datasets (datasets.py)
Train the model (training.py)
Face Recognition (recognition.py)

How to run ?
Make sure have executable permission.
Please make sure that you have folders called 'datasets' and 'trainer' in the same directory. 
Run in the command line the face_datasets.py for taking your face image as datasets. Don't forget to set each person's face to unique ID.
If you have more face to be include, change the ID and run the program again
Train your datasets by running training.py
Lastly, run face_recognition.py
